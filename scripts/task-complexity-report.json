      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of initializing a Flask project, including creating the directory structure, setting up a Python virtual environment, installing dependencies, creating requirements.txt, and verifying the setup with a basic run.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves several standard but essential steps for initializing a Flask project, including directory setup, environment configuration, and dependency management. While each step is straightforward, ensuring best practices (such as using the app factory pattern or blueprints for scalability) adds moderate complexity. The task is foundational and must be done correctly to support later development.[1][2][3][5]"
